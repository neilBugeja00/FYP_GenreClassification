Order & Purpose:

1. Download the FMA_Medium Dataset found from their github
2. Run the "Create genres_original" notebook to sort the dataset in the required genres
3. Run the "10 Second FMA Snippets" notebook to snip each song in the dataset in samples of 10 seconds each
4. Run the "Create MFCC_MFA" notebook to create an MFCC image of every song snippet
	4.5 (Optional) In my case, due to resource limitations, notebook "Seperate File" was used to create MFCC of x snippets before closing it and starting it again. This was done due to memory restrictions on my device.
5. Run the "Split MFCC in training and testing". Title is self explanatory, stratisfied sampling was done to split the snippets in a 80/20 split.
6. Run the "CNN Small Creation" to create the CNN Model.
